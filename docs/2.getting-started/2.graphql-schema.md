# Get GraphQL Schema

## GraphQL Introspection

It's often useful to ask a GraphQL schema for information about what queries it supports. GraphQL allows us to do so using the introspection system!
https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/

## Take a look

example graphql server
https://relay-doc-backend.vercel.app/api/graphql

open the doc on top left corner to see what queries, mutations it supports

## Pull down graphql schema

There are many way to pull graphql schema
we use a simple one [get-graphql-schema](https://github.com/prisma-labs/get-graphql-schema)

```
pnpm add -D get-graphql-schema

mkdir data
get-graphql-schema https://relay-doc-backend.vercel.app/api/graphql > schema.graphql
```

open `schema.graphql` and take a look :)
